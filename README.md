# Cognifyz Technologies Internship Project

This repository contains my solutions for the Python Development internship tasks provided by Cognifyz Technologies. The project is organized into three levels: Beginner (Level 1), Intermediate (Level 2), and Advanced (Level 3), with each level containing specific tasks.


### Intern Name: Mihir Borsaniya
### Internship: Cognifyz Technologies
### Project: Python & Web Development Internship
- Level 1: Tasks 1–5 Completed
